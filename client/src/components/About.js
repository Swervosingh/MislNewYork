      <h3>What is MislNy?</h3>
      <p>MislNewYork is an organization of young Singhs <br></br>who came together because of their like minded mindset. <br></br>This thought of furthering and reviving the morals, principles & beliefs <br></br>of our immortal ancestors was planted by Sant Baba Kuldeep Singh Ji, <br></br>our late head priest. This organization works on bettering the community<br></br>around it by doing selfless service and providing those without a voice with<br></br> a voice in Punjab. We’ve taken upon many community projects like serving <br></br>food during Covid to areas that do not receive government funding, to <br></br>having multiple toy and food drives at New York Presbytarian <br></br>children’s hospital, to giving homeless care package kits <br></br>with necessities for the winter. We strive on making an <br></br>earnest living, and taking out 10% of our earning and<br></br>using them towards the greater good. </p>
